====================
${policyDoc}
====================

A request has been submitted for budget:
- Requested Amount: $${requestedAmount}
- Justification: "${justification}"

Evaluate this request.
- If it is under $5,000, you should 'approve' it.
- If it is between $5,000 and $10,000, it is a soft threshold and requires a strong, solid justification.
  - If the justification is reasonable, you may 'approve'.
  - If the justification seems weak, you should 'counter' with a lower amount (typically $5,000) and explain why.
- If it is over $10,000, it is a hard threshold. You must 'reject' or 'counter' with a maximum of $5,000.

You MUST respond with a valid JSON object matching this schema:
{
  "decision": "approve" | "reject" | "counter",
  "counterAmount": 5000, // Include ONLY if decision is "counter"
  "reason": "A one-sentence policy-based explanation of your decision."
